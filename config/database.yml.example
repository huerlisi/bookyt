# Database configuration
# ======================
# This file can be use as a template for the database.yml file.
#
# If you're using the SQLite3 file-based database, all you have
# to do is copy this file to database.yml.
#
# While you may use the SQLite3 database, it has some issues
# with date handling. It's sometimes giving strange amounts
# in account views for opening balance etc.
#
# Search will only work with PostgreSQL, as we use its
# freetext search capabilities. So SQLite and MySQL are only
# usefull for playing around or migrating from Bookyt 1.x
#
# For production environments PostgreSQL is a better fit. In this
# case you need to setup the databases and adapt this file:
#
# 1. create the database and grant access
# 2. set username and password and possibly host settings in
#    the environment config.

# Common settings

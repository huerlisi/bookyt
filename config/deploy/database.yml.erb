# Database configuration
# ======================
# This file can be use as a template for the database.yml file.
#
# If you're using the SQLite3 file-based database, all you have
# to do is copy this file to database.yml.
#
# While you may use the SQLite3 database, it has some issues
# with date handling. It's sometimes giving strange amounts
# in account views for opening balance etc.
#
# For production environments MySQL is a better fit. In this
# case you need to setup the databases and adapt this file:
#
# 1. create the database and grant access
# 3. set username and password and possibly host settings in
#    the environment config.

# Common settings
# ===============
# SQLite3
sqlite: &sqlite
  adapter: sqlite3
  pool:    5
  timeout: 5000

# MySQL
mysql: &mysql
  adapter:  mysql2
  encoding: utf8

# Environments
# ============
<%= rails_env %>:
  <<: *mysql
  host:     <%= db_host %>
  database: <%= db_database %>
  username: <%= db_username %>
  password: <%= db_password %>

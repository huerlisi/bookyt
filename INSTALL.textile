We currently support installing on Debian 5.0 Lenny and Ubuntu 12.04 systems.

h2. Install Ruby'n'Rails

Bookyt is developed and tested using Rails 3.2 and Ruby 1.9.3.

Install packages needed:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install rubygems irb libruby-extras sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libmysqlclient-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev ruby-dev build-essential
sudo apt-get install git
</pre>

Then some gems:
<pre>
sudo gem install rake bundler
</pre>

h2. Testing

You currently need phantomjs version 1.8.1 or newer. You can get this on Ubuntu 13.10.

h2. Install Bookyt

Install current Bookyt from git repository. We'll use this checkout as working directory from now on:

<pre>
git clone http://github.com/huerlisi/bookyt.git
cd bookyt
</pre>

Install dependency gems:

<pre>
bundle
</pre>

Setup database:

Copy database.yml.example to database.yml and edit as needed. While you may use the SQLite3 database, it has some issues
with date handling. It's sometimes giving strange amounts in account views for opening balance etc.

<pre>
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
</pre>

Initialize the database:

<pre>
bundle exec rake db:setup
</pre>


h2. Setup admin user

There's a rake task to setup an admin user:

<pre>
bundle exec rake users:admin
</pre>


h2. Create account types

Account types need to be named correctly for calculation of the balance sheet
and profit sheet.

See db/seeds/locales for your convenience.


h3. Run

You should now be able to start Bookyt:

<pre>
rails server
</pre>

Bookyt is now available at http://localhost:3000

Enjoy!

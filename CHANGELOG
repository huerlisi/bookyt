is my personal favorite:-)

Give it a try at https://bookyt-demo.cyt.ch!

got some design love. You now may use alternative payment methods for

  by ESR.

  right side

1.3.2
=====
Tracking expenses with VAT got much, much easier. We've built a custom
form helping you to enter all those retailer recipes quickly.

Some bugfixes and the possibility to specify since when timesheets
should calculate the saldo for employees also made it into this release.

channels:

* Mail:        info@cyt.ch

Other notable changes:
* Fix invoice filter in people view.
* Include account code in account comboboxes in booking forms.

1.3.1
=====
We've given the timetracking module some love: filters in lists,
clever forms to do batch entries, nicer timelog. Directly printing
pages and reports in the browser now works great even in tabbed views.
Better view and form headings quickly tell you what you look at.
The salary pay slips had a major bugfix regarding bad rounding.

We have some great news for developers, too: We're working hard to
make contributing easy: some new helpers simplify
building new views; using great gems like inherited_resources make
controllers simple to understand, adapt, and build.

Of course our code is available commit by commit as soon as we code
it at https://github.com/huerlisi/bookyt.

Other bugfixes:
* Fix page header if not logged in
* Salary items show badly rounded amount in pay slip
* Invoice update sometimes fails validation for no obvious reason
* Fix projects creation
* Password reminder form has bad style
* Bad submit button label in login form
* VESR upload fails
* Fixed form for Bank Accounts
* Render list even if empty in generic index view
* Fix untranslated strings
* Fixed form for Bank Accounts

1.3.0
=====
We streamlined the interface and made it much nicer on smaller devices
like tablets and phones.

Beside dozens of usability fixes, balance/profit sheet reporting got
much more powerful. We now provide year by year comparison and better
print support. Search result now provide more information and all
sidebar filters are now unified in look and functionality.

Enabling mobile devices has been simplified tremendously by open source
components like Twitter Bootstrap 2 and simple_form. A big "Thank You!"
to all those involved in these and other projects!

Check it out, it's the best Bookyt ever:-)

  employee

1.2.2
=====
Another polishing release. It's the little things that make a big
difference!

Using zebrastriped lists is a small thing, but enhances usability
quite a bit. Better translations make it simpler to find what
you're looking for. Hints when a list contains no items tell you
why this list exists in the first place. Unified, cleaner design
of sidebar filters and pagers tell you what you see in no time.

And much more...

Check it out at https://bookyt-demo.cyt.ch!

Other Improvements:
* Much nicer and consistent booking entry

Major bugfixes:
* In invoice forms, the 'total' in the line item footer did not update,
  using a generic saldo line item now
* Manual bookings could get lost if assigned invoice gets updated
* Debit invoice PDF used today in text, now correctly using
  value date.

1.2.1
=====
Mainly focusing on small usability bugs and enhancements.

One outstanding feature did slip in though: not matching payments
bookings, imported from bank, can now be cleaned up by simply
clicking on action buttons. You may write off, book as extra
earning etc.

Oh, yes! There's another one: most pages will now produce sensible
print outs. Simply use your browsers 'print' action or press
<ctrl-p>.

Give it a try at https://bookyt-demo.cyt.ch!
